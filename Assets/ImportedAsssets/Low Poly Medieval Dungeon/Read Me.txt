Hello and thank you for purchasing Low Poly Medieval Dungeon package.

I have imported all 3D models in fbx format. Lightmaps are generated on import.

There are 89 prefabs. All models use one atlas texture.

Example Scenes have baked lights. 
- If lighting doesnt work properly, go to Lighting window and click Generate Lighting.

Texture is 512*512 png
